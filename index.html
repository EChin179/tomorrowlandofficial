                <h4>modes of green trasnportation</h4>
                <p>Currently, most vehicles still utilize enormous amounts of energy that cause devastating amounts of pollution, negatively impacting the environment and our health. Fortunately, there are several methods of green transportation that enlist numerous benefits, including fewer to no environmental pollution, lower financial cost, the contribution to the building of a sustainable economy, and improved health.<br><br>Environmentally sustainable modes of transportation include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Walking</li>
                  <li>Biking</li>

              <div class="text-box">
                <h4>implications on infrastructure.</h4>
                <p>While electric vehicles are a relatively excellent alternative fuel source compared to fossil-fuel powered cars, they unfortunately still indirectly cause pollution. Toxic elements within batteries can spew toxic fumes, and electricity generally isn't always generated sustainably.<br><br>Hence, the cleanest modes of transportation will always be walking, biking, and public transportation. To support an environment that encourages such habits, Tomorrowland must prevent urban sprawl, and have clean, wide, and accessible sidewalks, for both bikers and walkers. Public transportation will be critical to enforce accountability of citizens' habits, providing an accessible, clean, and efficient mode of transportation that should require no sacrifice on the part of the citizen in terms of comfort, security, and time.</p>

                <h4>importance of public transportation.</h4>
                <p>Encouraging citizens to move from high-emitting vehicles to more sustainable public transport will reduce the amount of emissions, improve air quality, and improve the health and standard of living for the population. As even electric vehicles leave some indirect carbon footprint on the Earth one way or another, encouraging a habit of utilizing public transport is vital to the sustainability of Tomorrowland.</p>
                <h4>maglev.</h4>
                <p>The term maglev is derived from 'magnetic levitation'. Maglev trains work on the principle of electromagnetic propulsion, wherein the cars are suspended, guided, and propelled using powerful magnets.</p><br>

                <h4>the hyperloop.</h4>
                <p>The hyperloop is a series of reduced-pressure tubes with pressurized capsules that can transport passengers at speeds of up to 700 mph. It is powered by an external electric motor, along with solar panels on the outside of the tube. Cheaper and more energy efficient than high speed rails, the hyper loop may be the best and cleanest solution so far to long distance travel.</p><br>

                <h4>electric, solar powered, autonomous buses.</h4>
                <p>E-buses are much better for the environment (depending on the cleanliness of their electric grid), with less vibration, less noise, and zero exhaust. They have lower operating costs and are overall easier to maintain. Solar panels can be installed on the top, which can help generate more electricity for the bus to run on. To minimize accidents, evolving technology can make the bus autonomous, creating less accidents on the road.<br><br>The only remaining issue would be that having an electric bus will require a complete do over of the bus system, requiring charging stations that are at least $50,000 a piece, not including the cost of new land.</p>

              <p>This futuristic route would be made up of an enclosed, elevated tube, enabling cyclists to ride all year round in comfort thanks to full climate control. A network of elevated cycle paths towering above city streets would not only make cycling less dangerous and more convenient, but could reduce congestion on highways and lessen the amount of carbon emission greatly.</p>
              <h4>smart roads.</h4>
              <p>Over a million people a year are killed in road traffic accidents, with tens of millions more injured. Smart roads that are connected to the internet of things (IoT) can help reduce road deaths, as IoT-enabled road sensors can instantly communicate with smart cars about the best ways to avoid hazards or adverse road conditions. Additionally, wireless battery chargers can be installed underneath roads, reducing the level of air pollution and virtually eliminating the need for fossil fuels to power cars.</p>
              <h4>charging stations.</h4>
              <p>An electric vehicle charging station, or the EV charging station, supplies electric energy for the recharging of plug-in electric vehicles—including electric cars, neighborhood electric vehicles, etc. To support mass use of electric vehicles, charging stations should be easily accessible to everyone, ensuring the highest level of convenience for sustainable living.</p>

              <h4>orbital rings.</h4>
              <p>The orbital ring is a strong steel cable in orbit just above the atmosphere—80km above Earth. It rotates, creating forces which try to make the ring fly apart into space, while gravity tries to pull it down to Earth. If spun at the correct speed, the two forces balance one another, allowing it to rotate seemingly weightlessly. A “cuff” can be built around the cable which would hold itself in place, unmoving, by magnetic repulsion. The structure would be connected to the ground by cables, with an elevator giving access to the ring in less than an hour.<br><br>Two Maglev train tracks—using magnets to move trains without friction—on the underside of the ring and another on the outside could transport passengers at incredible speeds, reaching the other side of the world in 45 minutes.</p><br><br>

              <p>Despite the seemingly outlandish nature of this solution, remember that the world’s current course towards the expansion of carbon-intensive air travel is just as unrealistic if we hope to avoid catastrophic climate change.</p>

                <h4>the dark side to renewable energy.</h4>
                <p>Wind and solar are increasingly popular sources of energy, but the sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. Renewable energy sources can be inconsistent, even at their best. Simultaneously, the pollution effects associated with creating solar panels, wind or hydroelectric turbines, and the materials needed to store large amounts of energy are tremendous. <br><br>Despite these shortcomings, there is a good chance that we will have to rely on renewable resources for a long while before dispensing of them completely. In the end, the goal will be less reliance on carbon-based fuel sources, and it is likely that a combination of solutions will make up our greener energy future.</p>

                <p><span>Space-based solar power</span><br>Most solar energy doesn’t actually make it into the Earth’s atmosphere, so space-based solar power can help transcend that obstacle. The challenges would include the cost of getting a satellite to orbit, as well as the conversion of electricity into microwaves that can be beamed down to the planet’s surface.<br><br><span>Embeddable solar power</span><br>Solar window technology turns any window or sheet of glass into a photovoltaic solar cell that harvests the part of the light spectrum that eyes can’t see. If every window was made to collect some form of solar power, it could be a viable local source of energy for homes everywhere.</p>

              <h4>human power.</h4>
              <p>With over seven billion people walking the Earth today, harnessing energy and generating power from this movement could possibly be one of the energy sources of the future.</p>
              <h4>hydrogen power.</h4>
              <p>Hydrogen is a clean and potent source of energy, and accounts for 74% of the mass of the entire universe. The only problem is that hydrogen atoms tend to only be found in combinations with oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen atoms. Removing this bond takes energy, which ends up being counter-productive. As a result, many people around the world are working on making these processes more effective.</p>
              <h4>magma power.</h4>
              <p>The center of the Earth has the temperature of 6000 degrees Celsius, and tapping into that geothermal heat could very well be another possible source of energy for the future.</p>
              <h4>algae power.</h4>
              <p>Algae grows almost everywhere, they are also a surprising source of energy-rich oils. Up to 9,000 gallons of biofuel can be “grown” per acre, making it one of many potential energy sources of the future.</p>

              <h4>fusion power.</h4>
              <p>Fusion is the reaction that powers the Sun. It’s produced when two light atoms fuse into one under extreme pressure and temperature. Fusion has the potential to deliver much more power than nuclear fission, but without the long-lasting radioactive waste. With its potential of offering an inexhaustible supply of zero-carbon energy, nuclear fusion is still difficult to scale because the process still requires more power than it generates with existing technology.<br><br>Nuclear fusion as a power source has never been given the necessary funding to develop it to fruition, but it's the one physically possible solution to our energy needs with no obvious downsides. The physics works out beautifully; all that is needed is proper investment and engineering breakthroughs.</p>

              <h4>trash talk.</h4>
              <p>Currently, waste management is a very linear process, and it is critical that it shifts to a more circular economy. This means that products need to be designed for disassembly at end-of-life. If usage of single-use plastics continues, then they should then be biodegradable in whatever environments they enter at end-of-life. The goods of today need to be seen as the raw materials of tomorrow. When that happens, products will begin to be made with the view of lasting longer and being easier to repair and dismantle.<br><br>There should also be an economical way to segregate waste. New technologies need to be developed to recycle specialized groups of waste, such as e-waste. Too many thrown away lithium ion batteries will eventually poison the environment.</p>

              <h4>waste to energy plants.</h4>
              <p>Waste to Energy (WTE), is a term that is used to describe various technologies that convert non-recyclable waste into usable forms of energy including heat, fuels and electricity. It can occur through a number of processes such as incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery.<br><br>Recovering energy from the waste that remains after recycling is an important part of sustainable waste management and is key to reducing waste that would be sent to landfills.</p>
              <h4>metals recycling.</h4>
              <p>In the process of combustion, metals can be recovered from the remaining ash for recycling. This avoids a tremendous amount of greenhouse gases and recovers valuable natural resources that would have otherwise been lost in landfills. The production and mining of new steel, aluminum, copper, and other metals products is also a carbon intensive process that negatively impacts the environment.</p>
